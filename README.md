## Building the package

An already-built jar file of the porject is provided on the [web site][].

This application is coded in Java and uses [Apache Maven][] for dependency
management and build system. After properly installing Java and Maven give the
following command in this folder to create an executable jar file:

    mvn clean compile assembly:single

An executable `.jar` file will be crated in the `target` directory. The jar file
is self-contained, that is it includes all the dependencies. Its name is
`vinem-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. Note that an Internet connection is
needed during the first run for the download of depencies.
